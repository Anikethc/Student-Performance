# Student-Performance

This Python program visualizes data and you can query it too from CSV data.

## Introduction

This project was for a technical assignment for a "Software Developer" internship. I had to create a program that makes querying the CSV data easier, along with some visualization.

## How to Use It?

Firstly, you can download the above files and store it all in one directory itself.

### 1) Installation

You should install some Python libraries first. They are `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `numpy`. You can do this by running the `pip install` command in your command line.

### 2) Using It

Run the `main.py` file and you get 8 options. You can then enter the option number, i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.

You then get an input to ask for some details. Go ahead and enter some details from the CSV file. **Example:** If it's asking for a employee ID, just go to the Employees CSV file and get a ID, it can be any ID for that matter.

IMPORTANT: When the program asks for your semester, you should enter the semester as "Sem_1" or "Sem_5" or "Sem_3" and so on. There are only 8 semesters.

1) **Employee Information** - Enter the employee ID and you get details about that employee.
2) **Department Information** - Enter the department ID and you get details about that department.
3) **Student Counselling Information** - Enter the student ID and you get details about that session.
4) **Student Performance** - Enter the student ID and you get his overall performance in a 'text' form.
5) **Number of Employees in a Department** - Enter the department ID and you get the number of employees in that department.
6) **Pie Chart of a Student in a Semester (Visualization)** - Enter the student ID and the semester. Then, you get the bar diagram of the student's marks in that given semester.
7) **Compare 2 Semesters of a Student (Visualization)** - Enter the student ID, the first semester, and the second semester. It compares the two semesters and gives you a bar diagram of both the semester's marks.
8) **Compare 2 Students in a Semester (Visualization)** - Enter the two student IDs and the semester you want to compare them in. It compares the two students in that given semester and shows you a bar diagram.
